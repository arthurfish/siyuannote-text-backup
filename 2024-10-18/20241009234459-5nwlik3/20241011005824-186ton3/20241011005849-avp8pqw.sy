Before I leaving WKU campus, I think I could get the right answers to so many problems, but now, I am so shame that I am still as ignorant as before. Fear from everywhere sometimes occupies my heart, not only from Chinese systematic problem but also the fear of traditional Chinese university educational. This year I am accepted from Suzhou(a name of a wealthy city, “zhou” means city in Chinese) University, whose rank is a little better than WKU, but not better much. Maybe I can pursuit my goal of immigration and becoming a powerful software engineer(and a ethical hacker, a safety engineer who can protect civilian’s privacy) in the new place. I am not sure I have enough toughness to overcome the barrier from bureaucrat(I know it exists in every campus, but in China, it is extremely a damage).

I went back to my hometown Xiangyang, selected my dreamed high school Xiangyang No. 4 High School. At the High School Participation Exam which held few years ago, my score is much more higher the line to join the “4th School”, which I want to enter since I am in elementary school. However, I had no rights to choose which school I would have. So in the end I am assigned to “5th School”, which is far from my home, administrate students strictly, and all of my friends were in “4th School”. I felt injured and angry because although I was outstanding but I still fall in a worse situation than most of my friends. That dissatisfaction made me participated the training of a programming competition named NOIP instead of studying to escape the sorrowful environment(Honestly speaking I played video games rather than practiced programming in most of times). So my scores dropped without suspense. My name occupied the last place of the class rank.(My class is a “fast class” than other class, which means everyone except me is top student in the city, or even in the province. Easy to imagine, my situation was pretty tough during the three years."}]},{"ID":"20241011010400-2mc5vc8","Type":"NodeParagraph","Properties":{"id":"20241011010400-2mc5vc8","updated":"20241011010400"},"Children":[{"Type":"NodeText","Data":"Which made it even worse is my father’s death. My father is a civil engineer, loves me and support me not only in learning but also my hobby of programming. At my 18 year’s birthday he just congratulated me, but the next day he died on heart disease. Then I noticed that I should do my best in everywhere because I have no one to rely on. To poll my grades from the transcripts’ bottom, I tried to use online lessons to help on my schoolworks. I don’t konw whether my choice good or bad, maybe I would get better grades in Chinese National College Entrance Examination. Finally, I get 621(Full mark is 750) in the first Exam. It not the worst grade, and pretty higher than my imagination, I can get to some “211”(except the “985”s, almost better that other Chinese university. But “985” s is better than “211”s) universities. However, I didn’t trust Chinese university or more honestly, I have bias toward Chinese university. So I choice WKU in the end, although I have 5 scores gap to obtain WKU’s 450000 RMB scholarship.(Today I realized although I meet the standard there still are too many uncertainty and danger on my way to put the money in my pocket)."}]},{"ID":"20241011010400-gmlaze6","Type":"NodeParagraph","Properties":{"id":"20241011010400-gmlaze6","updated":"20241011010400"},"Children":[{"Type":"NodeText","Data":"WKU is a pretty good place to self-learning.

Although the AI is a realm belongs to God, I will try my best to trespass it. Last November ChatGPT’s appearance made me surprised and shocked.

I tried to employe GPT4 to modification my article, to compose high school’s essay(this kind of essay is a mixture of shit and hypocritical), or even to help me to writing PowerShell code. The work it had done is pretty better than expectation. This summer I use GPT to help me learning German and Japanese. I found it is a good consulter but not a good teacher. It can just answer my question but can’t make a question set or a learning road to me, and can not help me master a new skill systematically. There are still space existing to explore in the AI’s application.(I heard there are ways to implement “Long and short period memory” to upgrade the token limit to let GPT do bigger work). Thanks to you, I took Ng Wu’s course in Coursera. I got the basic idea about RNN, word-embeding, and the Transformer. During the online learning period, I realized I am pretty dull to the pure theory. I can’t get the knowledge exactly without in-hand practice. This forced me to rethink the matters about the practice platform of university, and the answer is WKU’s practice platform is so small, this is the main reason I entered another university this year. Maybe it is a not good decision, there are still chances and opportunities in my road."}]},{"ID":"20241011010400-jxnkbdn","Type":"NodeParagraph","Properties":{"id":"20241011010400-jxnkbdn","updated":"20241011010400"},"Children":[{"Type":"NodeText","Data":"I love computer in a very early age.
